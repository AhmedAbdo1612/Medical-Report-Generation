Medical Report Generation Model
Overview
This project implements a medical report generation model using GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2) and Vision Transformer (VIT). The model generates detailed medical reports based on input data, providing valuable insights and summaries for medical professionals.

Features
GPT-2 Integration: Utilizes the power of GPT-2 for natural language generation, enabling coherent and context-aware medical report synthesis.
VIT for Image Understanding: Integrates Vision Transformer for understanding visual data, facilitating the generation of reports based on medical images.
Server Deployment: The model is deployed with a server, allowing seamless integration into existing healthcare systems.
